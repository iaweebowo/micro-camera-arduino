# Handheld Microscope Motor Assembly Control & Autofocus Code

Written by Idris Wibowo as part of the ICRA 2025 Conference paper ["Towards Closing the Loop in Robotic Pollination..."](https://saferoboticslab.me.gatech.edu/research/towards-robotic-pollination/).

Designed to work in conjunction with the Indoor Pollination repo, found [here](https://github.com/kczttm/IndoorFarming). This interfaces directly with the `arduino_interfaces_tool_box.py` file in that repository. 

This repo needs to be put in a PlatformIO folder to work properly. Alternatively, the `main.cpp` file can be turned into an Arduino file via copy paste.
